# gszminer
A highly specialized mining software for Gridseed and Zeus ASIC mining units

## Disclaimer

This is a fork from an outdated version of cgminer. I am not the author of cgminer nor this fork, as can be seen in the commits. I reccomend using a fresh version of cgminer or bfgminer instead of this, you may ammend the desired changes. Since the original repository vanished, this is left here for historical and study purposes.
